# Game Card Holder

This is an OpenSCAD model of a game card holder. The original design was done by
[condac](https://github.com/condac/gamecardholder), so kudos to that person.

I made a couple of improvements. Now the model is more tolerate of changing sizes. I wanted a
holder for Rivals of Catan cards (great 2-player game, by the way), which has 69mm square cards.
I also simplified the code a bit by way of learning some other OpenSCAD commands (module,
linear_extrude, for). Lastly, I made the connectors fit a bit tighter so a set of holders is more
stable. That might be dependent on having a higher quality printer, so you can adjust the 1mm space
between connectors in the code if needed.
